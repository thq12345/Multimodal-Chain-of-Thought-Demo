        "Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for having horns, is recessive to the H allele, which is for not having horns.nHaving horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.nNot having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype hh.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns is 4:0.

The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.nYellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with yellow fruit must have the genotype ff.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.nRed fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with yellow fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red fruit.",

        "Solution: To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Thingvellir Rift Valley, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.nIn Iceland, parts of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are above sea level. The Thingvellir Rift Valley is one example. This rift valley began to form as the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate moved away from each other. In this picture, you can see the gap that formed during a major plate movement along the rift. Gaps such as this form when the two plates move apart, creating a large crack in the crust. The last time this happened in the Thingvellir Rift Valley was in the spring of 1789. Since then, a walking path was built along the rift valley to allow park visitors to walk along the rift.nThe underlined part of the passage explains that the Thingvellir Rift Valley formed as the two plates moved away from each other, or diverged.

        "Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a golden body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a golden body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a gray body.nA gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.nThere are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype BB or Bb. These boxes are highlighted below.nA golden body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a golden body must have the genotype bb.nThere is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype bb. This box is highlighted below.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a golden body is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with a gray body for every 1 offspring with a golden body.",

        "Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.nVestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below.nNormal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with vestigial wings for every 2 offspring with normal wings.",
