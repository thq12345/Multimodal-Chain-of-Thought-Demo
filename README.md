# Multimodal-Chain-of-Thought-Demo

## Chain-of-Thought, explained in one sentence
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought refers to Model providing rationale in addition to giving answer to a question.

### Why does it matter?
It helps building explainable AI.

## What is this paper about?
The paper introduced a mini-model (less than 1B parameter) that combined textual transformer and visual transformer that provide rationale and solution to a given question that yields 20% better performance than 175B GPT 3.5 model.

Essentially, you provide the question, and an image demonstrating the problem, it will provide answer, and rationale to the answer.

The cool part is, usually this only happens with larger models, having a mini model that yields better performance than large models is very rare.

## How does the algorithm work?
